how to calculate CARBON EMISSION
# Carbon Emission Calculator

A simple web application that helps users estimate their annual carbon footprint based on transportation, electricity usage, and meat consumption.

## Features
- Users can input their weekly/monthly usage details.
- Calculates COâ‚‚ emissions based on predefined factors.
- Provides personalized suggestions for reducing carbon footprint.
- Simple, responsive design.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter values for:
   - **Miles Driven Per Week** (e.g., 100 miles/week)
   - **Electricity Usage** in kWh per month (e.g., 300 kWh/month)
   - **Meat Consumption** (times per week, e.g., 3 times/week)
3. Click the **Calculate** button.
4. View your estimated carbon footprint in kg COâ‚‚/year.
5. Read the suggestions to lower your footprint.

## COâ‚‚ Calculation Formula
- **Transportation:** `Miles per week * 0.404 * 52`
- **Electricity:** `kWh per month * 0.92 * 12`
- **Meat Consumption:** `Times per week * 22 * 52`

## Interpretation of Results
| Carbon Footprint (kg COâ‚‚/year) | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| < 5000 | Low â€“ Eco-friendly lifestyle! |
| 5000 - 10000 | Moderate â€“ Can improve. |
| > 10000 | High â€“ Consider reducing consumption. |
