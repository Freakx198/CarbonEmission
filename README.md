# Carbon Emission Calculator

## Overview
The **Carbon Emission Calculator** is a simple web-based tool that allows users to estimate their annual carbon footprint based on various factors such as transportation, electricity usage, and diet. It also provides suggestions to reduce emissions and offers an option to donate towards tree planting efforts.

## Features
- Input fields for:
  - Miles driven per week
  - Electricity usage (kWh per month)
  - Meat consumption (times per week)
- Calculates estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions per year
- Provides interpretation of the footprint level (low, moderate, high)
- Suggests tree planting as a way to offset emissions
- Donation link to **One Tree Planted** for biodiversity support
- Direct bank donation details for those who prefer manual transfers
- Responsive design with a clean UI
